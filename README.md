# The native web video

This is my first TypeScript project. To learn TypeScript I watched (this youtube video)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CaGUZNEobk&list=PL6QrD7_cU23kuUAl8WMgV98Wi9lykoITV&index=2] in which he expalins the typescript basics.

In the video he builds a todo app and I copied the app to practice my TypeScript.
